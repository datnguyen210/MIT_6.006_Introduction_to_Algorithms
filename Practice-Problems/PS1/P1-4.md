#### Reverse last half of a linked list
- First, find the half element of the list.
- Use 3 pointers to reverse each and every elements from that location to the end of the list.
```
prev=None
current = second_half
next= None

while(current and current.next):
    next= current.next
    current.next = prev
    prev = current
    current = next
```
